# BEI-ZHENGZHI

It only has BEI-ZHENGZHI.cpp. You need to compile it and you have BEIZHENGZHI.exe.Then put a file and its name is BEIZHENGZHI in the same directory with BEI-ZHENGZHI.exe. The file, BEIZHENGZHI has some line, another one of them has and only has a title. It's the title of recitation. 

Then you can run BEI-ZHENGZHI.exe and input a number of your recitation, it means you want to recital first N content of titles if you input number N. Then you can see a random title, and you can recital its content. Then you need answer the quation: Do you think your answer is true? You can answer y or n then press enter. You can also answer n if you can't recital it. If you answered n, it will ask you to write down the problem, after it you need to press enter.

I know it has many problem. I will solve them after tomorrow.
